## Module 3 – Exploring Compute Services

### Overview
This module introduced and compared AWS compute services, focusing on when to use managed, serverless, or container-based options versus full control with EC2. The goal was to understand the right tool for the right workload.  

### Key Points
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides full control over virtual servers, OS, and software stack. Best for applications requiring custom environments.  
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless, event-driven compute. No server management; pay only for execution time.  
- **Amazon ECS/EKS (Containers)**: Containers package applications and dependencies for consistent deployment.  
  - **ECS**: AWS-managed container orchestration.  
  - **EKS**: Managed Kubernetes for more control.  
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Platform as a Service (PaaS) for quick deployment of applications without managing infrastructure.  
- **AWS Batch**: Scales batch processing jobs automatically and efficiently.  
- **Amazon Lightsail**: Simplified VPS with predictable pricing, ideal for low-traffic apps or small businesses.  
- **AWS Outposts**: Extends AWS infrastructure to on-premises environments for hybrid workloads.  

### My Understanding
- **Lambda vs EC2**: Lambda is better for event-driven functions without server management; EC2 is for full customization.  
- **Containers**: Solve “works on my machine” issues by packaging dependencies. ECS/EKS handle scaling and orchestration.  
- **Batch**: Useful for parallel data or compute-heavy jobs.  
- **Lightsail**: Best for simple apps with predictable, low-cost requirements.  
- **Outposts**: Recommended for companies that need AWS services integrated with on-prem systems.
