## Module 2: Compute in the Cloud

### Overview
- This module introduced core compute services on AWS, focusing on how to run applications efficiently in the cloud.  
- Covered: Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and messaging services (SQS & SNS).  
- Goal: Understand how AWS compute services provide flexibility, scalability, and resiliency compared to on-premises servers.

### Key Points
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**  
  - Virtual servers in the cloud.  
  - Provides full control over operating system, configurations, and software.  
  - Pay-as-you-go model for compute resources.  

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**  
  - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.  
  - Improves application availability and fault tolerance.  

- **Auto Scaling:**  
  - Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.  
  - Ensures cost efficiency (scale in during low demand, scale out during peaks).  

- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):**  
  - Queue-based messaging service for decoupling applications.  
  - Stores messages until a component is ready to process them.  
  - Improves resilience — if one service goes down, others continue.  

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):**  
  - Publish/subscribe messaging system.  
  - Sends notifications to multiple subscribers at once (e.g., email, SMS, SQS, Lambda).  
  - Good for fan-out scenarios and real-time alerts.

### My Understanding
- EC2 gives me full flexibility to run applications on virtual machines without managing physical servers.  
- ELB prevents any one instance from being overloaded, ensuring smooth customer experience.  
- Auto Scaling makes apps cost-efficient and resilient by adjusting instance counts dynamically.  
- SQS is critical for decoupling microservices: if one is down, the rest of the app can continue running, and messages aren’t lost.  
- SNS complements SQS by broadcasting notifications to multiple endpoints at once.  
- Together, these services create highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant application
