## Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

### 🌐 AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Region** = a geographic area (e.g., Tokyo, Ohio).  
- Each **Region** contains multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.  
- **AZs** = one or more data centers, physically separated, connected by low-latency links.  
- Purpose: redundancy, high availability, fault tolerance, and reduced latency for global audiences.  

**My understanding:**  
A Region is a geographic area that contains multiple AZs. AZs improve fault tolerance because if one fails, others stay up. Regions also let me deploy apps closer to customers to lower latency.

### ☁️ Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Variable expense model** → shift from capital expense (buying servers) to operating expense (pay for what you use).  
- **Scalability & elasticity** → avoid over-provisioning; scale up/down based on demand.  
- **Faster time to market** → launch new applications without waiting on hardware.  
- **Focus on business value** → AWS manages infrastructure, customers focus on apps.  

**My understanding:**  
Moving to AWS helps cut costs because I don’t need to maintain servers, hardware, or staff. Costs are variable, so I only pay for what I use. Startups benefit especially since they don’t need to guess capacity.

### 🛡 Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS responsibilities**: “Security *of* the cloud”  
  - Physical security of data centers.  
  - Global infrastructure (network, hardware).  
- **Customer responsibilities**: “Security *in* the cloud”  
  - Patching guest operating systems.  
  - Configuring IAM roles & policies.  
  - Encrypting and protecting their own data.  

**My understanding:**  
Customers patch and maintain their OS and secure their data. AWS secures the physical servers, facilities, and network. AWS might notify customers of issues, but they don’t do the patching for you.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Cloud computing = cost savings, scalability, faster deployment.  
- Regions and AZs = core concepts for global infrastructure.  
- Shared Responsibility = AWS secures **of** the cloud, customer secures **in** the cloud.  
- Pay-as-you-go model helps startups and enterprises avoid over-provisioning.
