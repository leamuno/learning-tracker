### 🌐 AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Region** = a geographic area (e.g., Tokyo, Ohio).  
- Each **Region** contains multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.  
- **AZs** = one or more data centers, physically separated, connected by low-latency links.  
- Purpose: redundancy, high availability, fault tolerance, and reduced latency for global audiences.  

**My understanding:**  
A Region is a geographic area that contains multiple AZs. AZs improve fault tolerance because if one fails, others stay up. Regions also let me deploy apps closer to customers to lower latency.

### ☁️ Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Variable expense model** → shift from capital expense (buying servers) to operating expense (pay for what you use).  
- **Scalability & elasticity** → avoid over-provisioning; scale up/down based on demand.  
- **Faster time to market** → launch new applications without waiting on hardware.  
- **Focus on business value** → AWS manages infrastructure, customers focus on apps.  

**My understanding:**  
Moving to AWS helps cut costs because I don’t need to maintain servers, hardware, or staff. Costs are variable, so I only pay for what I use. Startups benefit especially since they don’t need to guess capacity.

### 🛡 Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS responsibilities**: “Security *of* the cloud”  
  - Physical security of data centers.  
  - Global infrastructure (network, hardware).  
- **Customer responsibilities**: “Security *in* the cloud”  
  - Patching guest operating systems.  
  - Configuring IAM roles & policies.  
  - Encrypting and protecting their own data.  

**My understanding:**  
Customers patch and maint
