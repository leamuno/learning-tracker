## Module 4 – Going Global

### Overview
This module explained how AWS’s global infrastructure is designed to provide low latency, fault tolerance, and compliance options for customers worldwide. It focused on **Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations**, and introduced **CloudFormation** as a way to automate infrastructure provisioning.

### Key Points
- **Regions**:  
  - Geographically isolated locations.  
  - Chosen based on latency, compliance, available services, and cost.  
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**:  
  - Multiple datacenters within a Region.  
  - Independent power, cooling, and networking → improved fault tolerance.  
- **Edge Locations**:  
  - AWS data centers that cache content closer to end users.  
  - Used by services like **Amazon CloudFront** for reduced latency in content delivery.  
- **CloudFormation**:  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service.  
  - Deploys consistent environments (dev, test, prod) using declarative templates (JSON/YAML).  
  - Automates provisioning and reduces human error.  

### My Understanding
- Companies choose a Region based on compliance, latency, cost, and service availability.  
- Edge Locations provide faster performance for global customers by caching data closer to them.  
- CloudFormation helps keep environments consistent across multiple locations by defining infrastructure as code.  
- Regions are isolated, and each contains multiple AZs that ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.  
- Together, Regions, AZs, and Edge Locations ensure high availability and a smooth experience for global users.
