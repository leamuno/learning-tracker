## Module 5 – Networking  

### Overview  
This module introduced the core networking components in AWS and how they work together to securely connect workloads. Covered topics included **VPCs, subnets, gateways, network ACLs, and security groups**, as well as options for connecting on-premises networks to AWS through **VPN** and **Direct Connect**. It also reinforced the role of **edge locations, Route 53, and CloudFront** in improving global performance.  

### Key Points  
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  
  - Logically isolated network in AWS.  
  - Enables creation of subnets across multiple Availability Zones.  
  - Provides full control over routing, security, and IP addressing.  

- **Security Groups vs. Network ACLs:**  
  - Security Groups = stateful, applied at the instance level, automatically allow return traffic.  
  - Network ACLs = stateless, applied at the subnet level, rules evaluated for both inbound and outbound traffic.  

- **Connectivity Options:**  
  - **VPN:** Encrypted connection over the public internet, flexible but higher latency.  
  - **Direct Connect:** Dedicated private connection to AWS for higher bandwidth, lower latency, and predictable performance.  

- **Edge Locations & Content Delivery:**  
  - AWS **CloudFront** uses edge locations to cache static and accelerate dynamic content closer to users, reducing latency.  
  - **Route 53** provides DNS services, routing global users to the nearest healthy endpoint.  

### My Understanding  
- VPCs provide a way to logically isolate workloads and manage them with subnets, gateways, and layered security.  
- VPN and Direct Connect offer different trade-offs: VPN is quick and cost-effective, while Direct Connect is high-performance and private.  
- Security Groups and Network ACLs complement each other: SGs protect individual resources, while ACLs govern whole subnets.  
- CloudFront and Route 53 ensure global workloads remain fast and resilient by leveraging AWS’s global edge network.
