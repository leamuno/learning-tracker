## Module 1.1 – Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

### Overview
- This module served as an introduction and syllabus outline for the course.  
- It explained what data structures and algorithms are, why they matter, and how the course is structured.  

### Key Points
- **Data Structure**: A way to organize and store data (e.g., arrays, lists, trees, graphs).  
- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.  
- **Importance**: Choosing the right data structure + algorithm combination can greatly improve performance and efficiency.  
- **Efficiency**: Often measured using *time complexity* and *space complexity*.  
- **Course Syllabus**:  
  - Arrays  
  - Searching (linear, binary)  
  - Sorting algorithms  
  - Linked lists  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  
  - More advanced optimization topics  

### My Understanding
- Data structures provide the “containers” for data.  
- Algorithms provide the “recipes” or instructions for manipulating that data.  
- Performance considerations are critical: a poor choice can make code run too slowly or use too much memory.  
- This module was mostly an orientation and didn’t require code implementation yet.
