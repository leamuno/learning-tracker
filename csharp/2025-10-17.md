## Yellow Book — Chapter 1: Computers and Programs  

---

### 📖 Key Concepts
- **Role of a computer**: Accept input → process instructions → produce output.  
- **Programs**: Sequences of instructions telling the computer what to do.  
- **Machine code**: Binary (0s and 1s) — the only form computers understand directly.  
- **Programming languages**: High-level, human-readable languages that need translation into machine code.  
- **Compiler**: Translates an entire program into machine code before execution.  
- **Interpreter**: Translates and executes code line by line (not deeply covered in this chapter).  
- **C#**: A modern, high-level, object-oriented language that compiles into intermediate language (IL) for the .NET runtime.  
- **Programs as recipes**: Ordered instructions executed step by step.  
- **Computers are fast but dumb**: They execute instructions quickly but without judgment or understanding.

### ✍️ My Understanding
- Computers only understand binary, so programming languages act as a bridge for humans.  
- C# is high-level because it is human-readable and abstracts away low-level machine instructions.  
- Compilers ensure code is valid and executable; without successful compilation, the program won’t run.  
- A program is just a recipe — step-by-step tasks that must be followed exactly.  
- Computers excel at speed but rely entirely on the programmer to provide correct instructions.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Programs = instructions → executed by computers.  
- High-level languages like C# are abstractions over machine code.  
- Compiler = essential tool for turning code into something a computer can run.  
- Regions vs Recipes analogy: Programs are linear instructions like cooking steps.  
- Computers are powerful but literal — programmers are responsible for clarity and correctness.
